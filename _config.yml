title:            A Holistic Memoir of the PhD Experience
tagline:          'Exploring the uniqueness of the PhD experience, one story at a time.'
description: >
  When considering or beginning a PhD, many of us read books and articles describing the experience awaiting us. But these are written from the perspective of the person who's written the article, because <i>every experience is unique</i>.
  
  They also have certain things in common. The PhD experience seems to go through a similar pattern for everybody, with similar highs and lows, trials and joys. Every experience is unique — <i>some of the time</i> — so what should you expect?
  
  This is a memoir of a PhD experience, where each short essay describes a different person's experience of their PhD. Perspectives are collected from different stages of study, different kinds of research, different research structures, different experiences — outlining the similarities and the differences, for you.
  


  This is the reference we wish we had when we began.
